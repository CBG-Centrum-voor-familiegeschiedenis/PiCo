# Example data about Abe Bos (Joure 1858 - Haarlem 1954), strike leader Railwaystrike 1903

This example contains five sources with data about one person, ie. it contains five PersonObservations. They refer to the same person, ie. the PersonReconstruction.

Discussion:
* should we use roar consequently and stop thinking :-)
    * use roar:documentedIn instead of rico:hasOrHadSubject?
    * use roar:Document instead of rico:Record and schema:Book?
    * use roar:hasRelation instead of homebrewed properties?

* is rdfs:label a MUST-HAVE?

Preliminary conclusion:
* Use roar, pnv and schema. 
* CBG addition would be the relevant "named individuals"
